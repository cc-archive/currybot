== Must have ==
* currybot has some concept of time, capable of acting like cron
  - use both 1) irc events and 2) signal module

* currybot can have rudimentary conversations
  - remind you when it's almost curry time
  - accept responses about whether you're going to get curry
  - remembers what you said you were going to get
  - asks you how you liked it, and remembers

* currybot conversations are in some awesome dialect or style

* intelligent parsing of curry menu
  - possibly use regexes

== Nice to have ==
* server runs in a shell for nicer starting / stopping / reloading

* functional and unit test suite

== Optional ==
* remove logging functionality, or only log "important" things
